# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## CSS development

We are using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our css framwork. frameworks helps us have a unified design accross the websites, and helps avoid certain pitfalls with css by writing more maintainable code. It also can help with accessibility considerations.

Tailwind differs from other frameworks in that they use a "utility first" approach, which aims to solve certain issues with css development at scale. [read about the argument for utility-first here.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)
 

### Isolated CSS

>generally, we should not need to use this as tailwind should take care of things, but having this option will help us as a backup / hotfix. 

Additionally, we are using CSS modules when writing component-specific stylesheets. CSS module help "isolate" css styles so they don't accidentally affect other code. 

import the CSS into the a component by first writing:

```import c from './index.module.css'```

this exposes the css class names into the component as js code, and then you uss in your code like how you would a js variable: 
```
<div className={c.exampleClass}>
</div>
```
if you have multiple classnames, you can join them using template literals, take note of the use of the tilda instead of quotes:

```
<div className={`style ${c.exampleClass} ${c.anotherExampleClass}`}> 
</div>
```
